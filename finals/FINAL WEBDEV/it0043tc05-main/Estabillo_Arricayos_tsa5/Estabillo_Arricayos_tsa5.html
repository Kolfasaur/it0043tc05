            <p class="desc"> Finn the Human 'or and formerly known as Pen' in the Animated Short is the main protagonist
                of the series Adventure Time.

                As shown in "Memories of Boom Boom Mountain," Finn appears to have been abandoned in the woods during
                infancy. He reveals that he made "boom boom" (a reference to poo) on a large leaf, fell on it, and lay
                there crying until joshua and Margaret (Jake's parents) rescued him from the wilderness to raise him
                alongside Jake, who becomes like a brother to him (as such, Jermaine is also Finn's adoptive brother).
                In "Memory of a Memory," a baby Finn is seen singing a song in the bathroom of what appears to be Joshua
                and Margaret's house. In "Henchman," when Finn is asked about his parents, he says Jake told him that he
                came from a cabbage, in jest. In "Susan Strong," Finn states that he knows nothing of his human parents
                or any other humans.</p>

                to stretch and manipulate his body, coming in handy on innumerable occasions throughout his and Finn's
                adventures. He is the son of Joshua and Margrate. Jake has a brother named Jermaine. Jake is 28 in
                magical dog years, though he rarely acts mature. In human years he is roughly the same age as Finn.</p>

            <p class="desc"> Earl of Lemongrab first appears in the episode "Too Young." He is the high-strung,
                overly-zealous, stubborn ruler of the land of Lemongrab, and the heir to the Candy Kingdom. He is the
                creation of Princess Bubblegum and the first of her experiments to go wrong. He was able to usurp the
                throne of the Candy Kingdom on the technicality of Bubblegum's de-aging. Once Princess Bubblegum was 18
                again, she fires him, and he returns to Lemongrab. In "You Made Me," Lemongrab upsets Princess Bubblegum
                by spying on candy people as they sleep. Princess Bubblegum, Finn, and Jake attempt to stop him by
                giving him three criminal candy people to govern, the Pup Gang. Lemongrab attempts to adapt to "candy
                styles" but is unsuccessful, so Finn and Jake are forced to invade Castle Lemongrab. When they fail to
                rescue the candy people, Princess Bubblegum creates another Lemongrab to live in Castle Lemongrab with
                the original Lemongrab to keep him company.</p>
